# How-To
- [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/)
- [Install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) or [GithubDesktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) for an easier time

Once you install above apps, clone `https://github.com/Crystal4B/demo.git` with git. once the files are cloned, go into the downloaded folder and run `hugo server` in your command line. This will start the website on localhost:1313.

If you want to change anything feel free to edit `hugo.toml`, or the .md files in the content folder. This might require you to run `hugo server` again but after that your changes should be visible on the website
